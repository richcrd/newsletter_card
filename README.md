### What I learned

### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained insights into several key aspects of front-end development. Here are some of the major learnings I'd like to highlight:

1. **HTML Structure**: I deepened my understanding of structuring web pages using HTML. By organizing elements such as the main container, image container, titles, and links container, I learned how to create a well-organized layout.

2. **CSS Styling**: Through styling with CSS, I enhanced my skills in customizing the visual appearance of elements. Utilizing techniques such as flexbox for layout and CSS variables for consistent color management, I achieved the desired design aesthetic.

By reflecting on these learnings and providing code samples from the project, I solidified my understanding of front-end development concepts and techniques. This project served as a valuable opportunity for me to reinforce my knowledge and skills in building user-friendly web interfaces.
